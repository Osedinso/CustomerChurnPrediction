This project aims to predict the probability of customer churn using machine learning models trained on a dataset of 10,000 customer profiles. Churn prediction is crucial for understanding customer behavior and implementing strategies to retain customers who are at high risk of leaving.

Key Features

Machine Learning Models: Trained multiple models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests) to predict churn probability with high accuracy.
Data Insights: Analyzed key factors influencing churn, including account tenure, customer demographics, and account activity.
Top Features for Churn Prediction: Identified the top 10 most important features impacting churn, providing actionable insights for customer retention strategies.
Probabilistic Predictions: Generates a churn probability score for each customer, helping prioritize intervention efforts.
Explainability: Each prediction includes a brief, data-driven explanation to help stakeholders understand the factors contributing to each churn score.
Project Highlights

Dataset: 10,000 anonymized customer profiles, including features like age, account balance, product holdings, geographic location, and activity status.
Model Training & Evaluation: Extensive model training and hyperparameter tuning to maximize prediction accuracy. Evaluation metrics such as AUC-ROC and F1 Score were used to assess model performance.
Interactive Dashboard: Created a user-friendly interface for business stakeholders to view churn predictions and explanations.
How to Use

Data Preparation: Preprocess and clean your customer data to match the feature requirements of the model.
Model Deployment: The models can be deployed for real-time churn prediction, generating churn probability scores for new customers.
Interpret Results: Use the explanations accompanying each prediction to understand the reasons behind each customerâ€™s churn risk.
